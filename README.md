# Modular ALU
FPGA-based ALU system designed and verified in SystemVerilog using AMD Vivado for the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA. Includes a parameterized full adder, N-bit adder/subtractor, and a shift-add-subtract ALU with registered I/O. Verified through exhaustive and randomized testbenches featuring automated result checking and golden model comparison.
